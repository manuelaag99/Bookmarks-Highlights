This is "BOOKMARKS & HIGHLIGHTS", a full-stack web application where users can create an account, log in, upload pictures of books and articles that they might find interesting, store them, classify them, and then sort through them. It is not a social network, where you can add other users. It is simply a storage website, primarily targeted at scholars and researchers who might need a resource to store notes.
